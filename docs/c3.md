All variables must have a type declared, and a name

Names must begins with a letter, underscore, or $

Variables are either primitive or object references

Primitives are built-in - boolean, char, int, float, etc

Everything that isn't a primitive is an object, and variables store references to them: an int variable contains an integer, but a Dog variable contains a reference to the Dog object, not the object itself.

The type of a variable can't be changed, the content can (unless marked final)

Array elements are variables, but an array is an object. A newly-created array of objects contains references of that type to null.

In a method, no reference to the object is needed: just call the method/variable as though native.

If a method takes a param, you must call it with an argument of the right type. If it has a type, it must return a value of that type.

Set variables to private to stop them being accessed except via getters & setters.

Uninitialized instance variables have a value - zero/false/null. Local variables (declared within a method) must be initialized or won't compile.

== is equivalent to eq - means "same primitive" or "same object". Have to use .equals() to find out if two different objects are equivalent.

For loops have two forms:
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
  for (String foo : ArrayOfStrings) {}

Casting: int foo = (int) floatValue;
